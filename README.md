Project Description

Employ supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using adult dataset. We will then explore the data and preparing the data for Evaluating the model performance. Our goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual earning more than $50,000.

This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with and ask for donations.

Census Income Data Set


Abstract: Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI

Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu /ml/datase...). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online]

The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the "fnlwgt" feature and records with missing entries.
